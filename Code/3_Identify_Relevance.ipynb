Since a loosening of regulations in late March, the FCC office in Gettysburg, Pa., has reported a three-fold increase in monthly license applications. Known to his radio friends as K-1-Hotel-Lima- Zulu, Carp operates as one of thousands of amateur radio enthusiasts in New England, where by all indications the hobby is flourishing. That removed a key impediment, especially to the involvement of younger aspirants, who previously had bridled at stringent ham licensing regulations requiring new radio operators to use Morse code. Now even novices can send their voice out into the ionosphere. The number of ham adherents is up, prices for start-up equipment are down. From a fairly stable figure of 128,000 memberships two years ago, the Relay League advanced to more than 145,000 in February. This week, according to the FCC, some 428,710 hams are licensed to deploy their dark banks of components, their busy racks of dials and tangles of wires, in basements and attics and spare bedrooms from Barnstable to Barrow, Squantum to Seattle.\n",

      "For one thing, federal rules governing the pipeline companies that move gas from producer to consumer forbid rate adjustments based on anticipated changes in the price of decontrolled gas. Because rates can be adjusted only after a price change by producers, any increase or decrease will not show up until next spring or summer when the pipelines file their \"purchased gas adjustments\" with the Federal Energy Regulatory Administration. But even then, hardly anyone involved in the $65-billion-a-year industry that provides one-fourth of the nation's energy expects any significant price change.

      "- A modified deregulation of bank credit card interest rates, which would permit banks to charge interest above the currently mandated 18 percent if in any given quarter the rate on 91-day Treasury notes exceeds 18 percent when it is multiplied by two. Legislation which would reduce employers' unemployment compensation tax liability by as much as $90 million is expected to be passed early in the 1985-86 session. Although nine bills were introduced in the Legislature last year, none was acted upon. - Regulation of corporate use of video-display terminals in business. But the defeat sets the stage for an absolute must for the employer community in the Legislature as early as possible in 1985.\" Vigorously supported by groups such as \"9-to-5,\" an organization of clerical workers, nine bills were filed for the session. Thus, if in a given quarter the 91-day bill rate was 9.2 percent, banks could charge 18.4 percent for that quarter. Another area where lack of legislative action favored business, in AIM's view, was the failure of the Legislature to take up measures setting up regulations on the occupational use of video- display terminals. - Creation of a state building code commission to provide uniformity in the administration and enforcement of the building code at the local level.

The plant closed Dec. 10, 1983 for its regularly scheduled refueling. The consultant firm's report is due soon, Monahan said. While it was off, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered Pilgrim to check for cracks in the stainless steel pipes in the boiling water reactors.

      "The first few years were characterized by a multiplicity of competing routes and fares and an enormous but often chaotic expansion of the airline industry: Since deregulation, 240 new airlines have been started - and 35 carriers have gone bankrupt. \"The idea of getting government off our back is a myth; you can't live without regulation, and air travel is such an important part of national existence that it can't be left totally in the marketplace,\" said Bernard Garber, president of Garber Travel. \" Many in the travel industry question whether abolition of the CAB will have any effect on the way US airlines operate. At the conclusion of the CAB's 10-minute final meeting last Monday, a Marine bugler sounded \"evening colors,\" the call traditionally played at sunset on military installations. Much of what the CAB was doing didn't need to be done, but it took years to structure a workable system, and you don't prune a forest by cutting down all the trees. The board's demise formally concludes the process of civil aviation deregulation that began in 1978. \"There was a lot of confusion when fares were deregulated, and it was difficult for both travel agents and the public,\" said a spokesperson for the American Society of Travel Agents, \"but agents have learned how to cope, and because it is still confusing, the public knows it needs to go to an expert to get help to find out what fares and services are being offered; so, it has really been good for travel agents.\" The sun also rises, in other words. The air travelers rights that DOT now must uphold include:     - BUMPING - Airline's may overbook but must arrange alternative travel for bumped passengers so that they arrive at their destinations within an hour of the original arrival time. But, many of the board's functions, including enforcement of consumer protection regulation, approval of rates and routing of international carriers, have been transferred to the Department of Transportation, making that agency, in a sense, \"the new CAB.\" On paper, deregulation is completed, but one final phase has not been fully implemented. The board's sun has indeed irrevocably set, and when it went down, history was made: The CAB becomes the first major federal regulatory agency ever to be completely abolished. Deregulation removed the antitrust immunity enjoyed by the Air Traffic Conference (ATC), the airline industry- sponsored body which controlled ticket stock and administered ticketing procedures, allowing only airline offices and approved travel agents to issue tickets. Initially, the CAB's consumer-related responsibilities were to be distributed to various government agencies, including the Federal TradeCommission and the departments of Justice and Commerce. The ending of travel agent ticketing exclusivity is expected to eventually result in supermarkets, department stores and corporate travel departments issuing airline tickets, along with travel agencies. The ATC has been replaced by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), which recognizes both travel agents and \"other persons\" as ticket sellers - but has yet to accredit any of the latter. The jury is still out but we could just be changing one set of initials for another set,\" Garber said. For travelers, one of the CAB's most important functions and in its final years perhaps the most important function, was administering a large body of consumer-oriented regulations governing everything from how long a charter flight can be delayed before passengers get their money back to smoking restrictions on aircraft. The fact that consumer regulations were transferred intact and in a body to DOT, which is now solely responsible for enforcing them, is considered a victory for consumer groups.

      "The Department of Environmental Quality Engineering appears committed to this course despite an admission from Rod Gaskell, director of DEQE's wetlands division, that the mall project \"would never pass the new standards.\" The state's inclination to approve the project reopens concern about the environmental policies of Governor Dukakis. The state's rationale for allowing Pyramid to play by the old rules is based on a situation in which an Ohio company applied for - and was denied - a wetlands permit for Sweedens Swamp under the old regulations. Enviromental Affairs Secretary James Hoyte has justified this stance by noting that agency regulations give the state leeway to permit development in disputed areas, while subjecting such projects to state review to \"maximize the opportunity for environmental protection.\" A New York company's proposal to build a 100-store shopping mall in an Attleboro swamp calls for filling 25 acres of wetlands, five times the limit allowed under 1983 regulations. When Pyramid stepped in with plans to fill 25 acres, the state decided against requiring the proposal to meet the newest standards. Before it bowed out, the company was told its project might pass if plans were scaled down to meet then-operational environmental standards. DEQE must still decide whether it will uphold the previous denial of the wetlands permit or allow the mall to be built. A year ago, state environmental officials informed the Pyramid Companies that it could proceed under less restrictive wetlands regulations than the five-acre fill limit.

      "Now, as Baldessarini notes, downregulation may simply be one of nature's homeostatic - or steady state regulating - systems; it may be the increased activity of the receptors that don't shut down that is involved in the efficacy of antidepressant drugs, he reasons. Though the correlation of severe depression and insufficiencies of norepinephrine and serotonin is strong, no one has proved beyond a doubt that the chemical deficit causes depression, nor for that matter, that depression causes the chemical deficit. And, studies show, it may or may not cause downregulation of the receptors on the far side of the synapse. There is an interest in such new drugs as Bupropion, and before it in other so-called atypical drugs that have at least some antidepressant effects (trazadone and alprazolam, for instance) because these chemicals don't fit even the recently expanded depression theory. Other norepinephrine receptors on the receiving cell continue to do their job, however, possibly even more effectively. \"This means,\" muses Stern of Burroughs Wellcome, \"that either our theories of depression are incomplete, or at worst, totally wrong.\" To account for the fact that most antidepressants seemed to cause downregulation, yet the opposite would seem necessary to combat depression, scientists in the last several years have had to expand the original theory. This timing coincides remarkably with another piece of the puzzle, the process by which one type of receptor on the far side of the synapse gradually begins to \"turn a deaf ear,\" as Baldessarini puts it, to the increased norepinephrine in the synapse. Some of the neurotransmitter also \"kisses\" similar receptor sites on the sending cell, providing a feedloop that regulates how fast the cell produces more neurotransmitters. There in the synapse, the transmitters do their work, floating quickly to the receiving cell to land - or briefly \"kiss,\" as some scientists say - the awaiting receptor site. This process is called \"downregulation,\" or desensitization. Shortly after the first cell squirts out its transmitter, \"transport sites\" or channels in its membrane pull back in much of the neurotransmitterfrom the synapse, through a process called \"uptake.\" In effect, it partially shuts down the receiving cell's response. A key part of this feedback system consists of specific receptor sites - many of them named and \"mapped\" by neuroscientists only in the last several years - on the membranes of both the sending and receiving cells. Until recently, all known antidepressants appeared to cause downregulation, prompting some scientists to believe that downregulation must be the way the drugs worked. In a normal person, brain cells secrete the right amounts of these neurotransmitters, amounts delicately regulated through feedback loops between nerve cells. Yet this was paradoxical, since this shutting down process would mean that fewer norepinephrine-stimulated messages would be transmitted, not more. Bupropion, for instance, doesn't work by stopping the metabolic breakdown of norepinephrine, nor does it block the uptake from the synapse. ['new drug']\n",

      "The rules resulted in a 50 percent reduction in the number of patients receiving ECT and an increase in the average age of those receiving it. In 1967, Utah became the first of many states to respond by passing a statute controlling use of ECT. Crowe and Greenblatt helped revive the debate last year in journal articles that contended ECT is safe and more rapidly effective than drugs in many serious depression cases and has been needlessly overregulated. In 1975, to avoid legislative mandates, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health became the first to issue its own regulations on ECT, requiring hospitals to report the number of ECT applications monthly, to strictly follow consent procedures, and to limit the number of treatments a patient received each year to 35 or less.

According to Globe interviews with medical and government officials involved in the controversy, the industry has used its access in the deregulation-minded political corridors of the Reagan Administration to help block mandated labeling of its product; threatened or used lawsuits to force the government, the broadcast media and a major physicians' group to tone down, delay or withdraw warnings about the link; and even produced its own ads suggesting that no such link exists. Tozzi, who has now represents companies seeking regulatory relief, acknowledged that he met with White and other industry officials and considered their objections to the labeling and the four studies. He denied charges by Wolfe and others that he relied on the industry's opinion while ignoring the consensus among government health officials that aspirin was linked to Reye's. During the same period, the aspirin industry has repeatedly frustrated attempts by health officials to warn the public of the danger, insisting - with some support in the medical community - that the studies were flawed and urging pediatricians to continue prescribing aspirin for children with flu and chicken pox. But Reagan, who had formed a \"Task Force on Regulatory Relief\" when he took office, issued an executive order requiring that all new regulations undergo a cost-benefit analysis by the Office of Management and Budget. \"The industry, with the complicity of the Reagan Administration, has taken actions that have resulted in deaths and injuries to hundreds of children in the face of strong scientific evidence linking aspirin to Reye's syndrome,\" Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, the director of Public Citizens Health Research Group, a consumer group founded by Ralph Nader, charged in an interview yesterday.

      "Or for that matter between 3.987 and 2.4, which in a 12-ounce serving would amount to .1896 ounce. And in two states, Illinois and Kentucky, it is left to local option. In effect, one man's malt liquor is another man's beer. To further confuse matters, none of this is regulated by the federal government but is left up to the individual states, which have varying rules. The 3.2 beer, of course, contains 3.2 percent alcohol by weight, so the difference is more in the minds of the drinker and the regulatory agency. One more confusion: In Germany, where the consumers are more technically minded about their beers, the original gravity is often stated on the label in large figures. Note that Pabst Extra Light is actually less potent than 3.2. Some German brews sold here as beer a few years ago are now labeled malt liquor because of state regulations. While this list only includes two of the beers that Esecson asked about, it does make a point: The variations are minimal. ['federal government', 'individual state', 'state regulation']\n",
      "Not a hint is offered about what secular humanism means. The department, trying to implement a section of the 1984 Education for Economic Security Act, has proposed a regulation that would deny funds for programs that local officials define as the teaching of secular humanism.

Wednesday's vote was taken after the FinCom reviewed the use of CDBG money for the purpose described in the award letter:     To provide a \"Tenant Education Assistance Program\" that will \"assist tenant groups in forming associations with elected officers; conduct workshops to familiarize tenants with federal, state and local housing regulations and policies; and conduct workshops to familiarize tenants with their housing rights, particularly with regard to discrimination, code compliance, evictions and rent increases,\" the letter said.

      "A critique prepared for Alleghany by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets says it is difficult to predict market conditions six months to two years from now, the market is less receptive to public offerings than it was in 1983, and \"research analysts on Wall Street are no longer strongly recommending thepurchase of railroad stocks.\" It was an idea that the Department of Transportation, which favors a one-on-one sale, had considered and abandoned. The Department of Transportation views a sale to a single entity with proper restrictions as the safer alternative. Today, slimmed down and speeded up by its foxy old chairman, L. Stanley Crane, and boosted by deregulation, $7 billion in federal funds and wage sacrifices by labor, it is a money-making company that is beginning to look interesting to some investors. Conrail is expected to report nearly $500 million in earnings for 1984, upfrom $313 million in 1983 and a $244 million loss as recently as 1980. But Conrail has lived to confound its critics. Like Norfolk Southern and the Marriott group, Alleghany has offered about $1.2 billion for the railroad. The nightmare in an Administration committed to deregulation and privatization is that Conrail might fail in the private sector and revert to government ownership. Alleghany also refers to the \"slowing market,\" the threat of railroad reregulation and an unsettled labor situation as a result of the expiration of the industry's labor contracts last June.

Stores already in business would be exempted from the new regulations, says Martin, admissions director at University of Lowell, \"but they would be dealt with by picketing.\" The regulations \"would make it so difficult for a new pornography store to open that the owners will change their minds about opening here,\" says Larry Martin, a former member of the City Council and now a leader in the drive. \" ['public facility', 'new regulation', 'former member']\n",

      "Meanwhile three proposals are before the federal Energy RegulatoryCommission to import three times that amount of gas - up to 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas daily - from Alberta. That remark, though, and the meetings with utility executives and state regulators that have followed, have had a chilling effect and \"changed the atmosphere\" in the talks that were ongoing, says Hydro- Quebec vice president Bernard Guertin. The issues, Hodel and his aides have said, are these:     - Can this power be reliably imported over a distance of 1500 miles fromfrom Hydro-Quebec's multibillion-dollar James Bay hydroelectric power project on the edge of the Arctic tundra? The competition, however, includes two pipeline-company combines that propose major construction projects, each worth $1 billion, to bring the gas in via the Midwest. Already a year of \"pre-hearing conferences\" have been held in Washington and at least six months of formal hearings will begin later this year. The Algonqiun group had 30 percent and was scrapping for the rest. he commented to an industry newsletter interviewer. This rivalry is resulting in prolonged regulatory proceedings.

Chemical Waste Management spokesman Bob Reincke said no environmental damage was caused at the site. \" The agency filed a civil administrative complaint with EPA's regional hearing clerk yesterday, alleging that the toxic-waste handler violated federal regulations governing the \"use, record keeping and marking of PCBs between 1980 and 1983\" in storing the material. We believe that the collection of a substantial civil fine is justified given the history of serious violations at this facility,\" said William H. Sanders, director of the EPA's Region 5 Environmental Services Division, which includes Ohio. The agency charges that more than 6 million gallons of contaminated liquid later were sold by the company as reclaimed oil. The Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday that it is seeking the largest toxic waste penalty in its history, $6.8 million, against Chemical Waste Management Inc. of suburban Oak Brook. The EPA contends Chemical Waste Management employees at the Vickery site illegally discharged high levels of PCBs into waste lagoons in an effort to dilute the PCBs and avoid the federal regulation requiring PCB fluids to be destroyed by incineration, Donohua said.
